## Getting Started
This is my project for Software Dev. It is an employee management system, that utilizes JDBC to connect to DBeaver (mysql).

Make sure you make the necessary tables for it. Refer to my script.txt file.

Simply just edit the java file and change the root password to your own to get started.
